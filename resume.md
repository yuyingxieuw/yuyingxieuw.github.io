# Yuying Xie
I am a PhD student in the Department of Geography at the University of Washington. I am trained as a feminist and labor geographer. My research focuses on the intersection of labor, gender, and migration, and my current project is looking at platform economy and how new digital technology reorganizes global labor (im) migration.
